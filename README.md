A php framework based on MVC concepts

# Disclaimer
This is a project I am working on in my spare time. Currently it is *very* much in development and is liable to have breaking changes made frequently. *You've been warned.* As the project goes further into development I will make resources on how to actually use it. Until then you're free to explore it on your own.
